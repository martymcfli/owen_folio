# Personal Operations Dashboard (Raspberry Pi)

**Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress

If I'm going to help companies optimize their operations, I should probably optimize my own life first. This dashboard runs 24/7 on a Raspberry Pi 4 in my apartment.

## What I Track

### Work Metrics
- GitHub commits per week
- Emails sent/received (Gmail API)
- Calendar utilization (% of week in meetings)
- Job applications submitted

### Health & Habits
- Daily steps (Apple Health sync)
- Workout sessions logged
- Days since last music production session
- Books finished this month

### Finance
- Monthly spending by category (Plaid API)
- Budget vs. actual
- Net worth trend

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM)
- **OS:** Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless)
- **Database:** SQLite (local storage)
- **Dashboard:** Grafana (web interface)
- **Data Collection:** Python scripts + cron jobs
- **APIs:** Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub, Apple Health, Plaid

## Why This Matters

You can't improve what you don't measure. By tracking my own productivity and habits, I'm applying the same operational rigor I bring to companies.

**Personal insight:** Discovered I'm 3x more productive on days with <4 hours of meetings. Now I block "focus time" aggressively.
